I started running last week after almost a month off. I'm taking it slowly, and I'm really trying to pay attention to any signs of injury. My left heel seems to be fine, but I have had a little pain in my right achilles tendon, and I never had pain there previously. Weird. I haven't run over two miles, yet.  I'm not especially motivated either, but I suspect that will come as I ramp up my mileage. My plan is to run 3-4 times a week, and try to be up to around 15 miles a week in two weeks.

My training for the half will obviously be much reduced, and my goal of 1:30 won't be happening either. I'd like to run 7:30 miles, which puts me around 1:40.
