Well, just as I was starting to train for the Half Pig, I've had to stop because of an injury. As I mentioned, [I took an extra rest day](http://hillrepeats.com/blog/2012/02/15/calling-a-hill/) because I felt like my body could use some rest. I had a tempo run on [the schedule](http://www.halhigdon.com/training/51133/Half-Marathon-Advanced-Training-Program/) for Thursday, and I started out fairly well, but some mild pain on the outside of my left ankle progressed quickly, and by mile 3 I knew I needed to stop. It was hard to accept I couldn't keep going, but  I knew the damage was done, so I made the "help, come pick me up" call to my wife and have spent the last few days trying to rest my foot and not think too much about it. It's been tough.

Internet self-diagnosis seems to indicate peroneal tendonitis, but a visit to the chiropractor didn't really confirm that. In any case, it seems to be a common injury for those adapting to minimalist shoes and doing too much, too soon. I suspect my hill repeats earlier in the week didn't help much either. In any case, gotta wait for it to heal before I can do anything else.
