I spent a month trying to get into shape. I'll go into more details at some point about my training, but I managed to get into enough shape to run the Flying Pig Half Marathon in 1:39:41. I kinda re-injured my heel, so I'm resting up and coming up with a plan to getting to 1:30 this fall.

More to come on the training plan in the last month, race day, and footwear choices.
