That's usually what I've told people whenever I've mentioned that I ran a 5K or had gone for a run in an attempt to stay in some level of fitness. It's been 12 years since I regularly ran cross country in high school, and there have been years at a time where I haven't ran almost at all. Sure, in the last 6 years I've done a few 5Ks in respectable times, and I've even run regularly for a few months at a time. But I've never considered myself a runner, and I probably wouldn't even have used that description about myself when I was running 40 miles a week and 17 minute 5K races back in high school.

I never considered myself a runner because I've never really enjoyed running. But I've begun running again, and I've been enjoying it. A coworker of mine trained for a marathon in the fall, and his constant talk about his training plan kindled the thought of commiting to a race and seeing if I could perform well with a new challenge. I love having a plan and devoting myself to it, and I decided that in order to get back to the shape I'd like to be in and prove that I wasn't past my prime, it was time to commit to a goal and see what happens. I've registered for the Flying Pig Half Marathon in Cincinnati, OH on May 6th, and I want to run it in 1:30. The next three months should be interesting.
