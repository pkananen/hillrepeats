It has been over two weeks since I injured my heel and I stopped training. Thankfully, it's getting better, but it's not ready to run on yet. Although I suspected peroneal tendonitis at first, the presence of pain on both sides leads me to believe it could be achilles tendon bursitis. I did my hill repeats workout in Merrel Barefoot Trail Gloves, and I'm pretty sure that the steep downhill impact caused my problem. In any case, I continue to wait.

As soon as I found out I was injured, my motivation to eat well went out the window. I also stopped going to the [climbing gym](http://www.rockquest.com) to do some climbing workouts that would keep me off of my ankle. Being injured really affected my attitude and desires, and 2 weeks in I don't really seem to care much about my goal. That makes me sad. I just hope my motivation comes back when I'm well enough to run again.
